INTRODUCTION					*vim-foldround-introduction*

*vim-foldround* is a plugin to walk around |foldmethod| of the current window.


=============================================================================
INSTALL						*vim-foldround-install*

Use Plug.vim, neobundle.vim, or whatever like:
>
	" Plug.vim
	Plug 'lambdalisue/vim-foldround'

	" neobundle.vim
	NeoBundle 'lambdalisue/vim-foldround'

	" neobundle.vim (Lazy)
	NeoBundleLazy 'lambdalisue/vim-foldround', {
	      \ 'on_func': 'foldround#',
	      \ 'on_map': '<Plug>(foldround-',
	      \}
<
Or copy the repository into one of your |runtimepath| of Vim.


=============================================================================
USAGE						*vim-foldround-usage*

This plugin does not provide default key mappings so define your mapping for
|<Plug>(foldround-forward)| and/or |<Plug>(foldround-backward)| in |vimrc| like:
>
	nmap <C-f>f     <Plug>(foldround-forward)
	nmap <C-f><C-f> <Plug>(foldround-forward)
	nmap <C-f>b     <Plug>(foldround-backward)
	nmap <C-f><C-b> <Plug>(foldround-backward)
<
Then hit <C-f>f to change to the next |foldmethod|. foldround automatically
detect the current foldmethod and select a next one.

If you would like to limit available foldmethods, use |foldround#register()|
to register your own rule like:
>
	"
	" NOTE: Later registration is prior to be used.
	"
	" Disable foldround when the buffer is in 'diff' mode.
	call foldround#register('.*', [
	      \ 'disable', 'manual', 'indent',
	      \ 'expr', 'marker', 'syntax'
	      \])
	" Use 'syntax' and 'marker' in Vim scripts
	call foldround#register('.*\.vim$', ['syntax', 'marker'])
	" But in Vim scripts in ftplugin directory
	call foldround#register('ftplugin/.*\.vim$', ['syntax'])
<
Note that if you would like to set a default |foldmethod| of a particular
|filetype|, use your |ftplugin| to define a default value (that is not a part
of this plugin's bussiness).

INTERFACE					*vim-foldround-interface*

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUNCTIONS					*vim-foldround-functions*

foldround#register({rule}, {methods})		*foldround#register()*

	Register a new foldmethod detection rule.
	{rule} is a |regular-expression| which will be compared with an
	absolute filename; expand('%:p'); of the current buffer.
	{methods} is a |List| which contains the few of the following values:

	'disable'	Folds are disabled.
	'manual'	Folds are created manually.
	'indent'	Lines with equal indent form a fold.
	'expr'		'foldexpr' give the fold level of a line.
	'marker'	Markers are used to specify folds.
	'syntax'	Syntax highlighting items specify folds.
	'diff'		Fold text that is not changed.

	foldround will try to select one of foldmethod listed in {methods}
	for a buffer which name follow the {rule}.

	Note that 'diff' is only available when 'diff' is listed and the
	buffer is in |diff| mode. It will be ignored if the buffer is not in
	|diff| mode or warned when 'diff' is not listed and the buffer is in
	|diff| mode.

foldround#forward({offset})			*foldround#forward()*

	Select (n-th) next available foldmethod. |v:count1| is used when no
	{offset} is specified.
	Note that it may change the value of 'foldenable'; set |nofoldenable|
	for 'disable' and |foldenable| for others.
	See also |<Plug>(foldround-forward)|.

foldround#backward({offset})			*foldround#backward()*

	Select (n-th) previous available foldmethod. |v:count1| is used when no
	{offset} is specified.
	Note that it may change the value of 'foldenable'; set |nofoldenable|
	for 'disable' and |foldenable| for others.
	See also |<Plug>(foldround-previous)|.
